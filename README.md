### Hi there 🌞

My name is Alisa Vynohradova and I am a software developer. I live and work in Canada, but was born in Ukraine. I am a results-driven full-stack developer with excellent collaboration skills. I have a lot of energy and positivity that I am willing to share with people!

# About Me:
📄 I currently work at a software consultancy called Vehikl, and I have been working there for more than 4 years now! <br>
🍵 I love creating different drinks (mocktails and cocktails) and filming them! <br>
✏️ I've mostly worked with TS, JS and PHP <br>
🖥️ I really like working on the front-end, but I have extensive experience with the back-end <br>
