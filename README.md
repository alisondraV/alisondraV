### Hi there 🌞

My name is Alisa Vynohradova, I am a Ukrainian software developer based in Ontario, Canada, blending technical expertise with a creative flair. With a passion for full-stack development and a knack for collaboration, I thrive in crafting innovative solutions that connect people and ideas. Beyond the code, I bring creativity and detail to everything I do, whether it’s building dynamic applications or curating experiences like crafting cocktails and hosting memorable events. Contact me if you want to talk code or mixology :)
